# Loan-Application
Our Python and Tkinter-based Loan Eligibility Checking project offers a seamless solution for individuals looking to determine their loan eligibility and even apply for it. With a user-friendly interface, users can input their financial information, and the system provides an instant assessment of their eligibility for loans.

Problem Definition:
The existing loan application process is manual and time-consuming, leading to potential errors and delays. Customers face challenges in calculating their savings and determining the best loan option for their needs. This project addresses these issues by providing a digital solution that simplifies the loan process, offers accurate savings calculations, and improves overall efficiency.

System Environment:
The loan assistance app is built using the Tkinter framework, a Python library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUI). The app is designed to run on desktop computers with Python installed and interacts with a secure database for storing and retrieving customer information.

System Analysis
System Description:
The loan assistance app consists of the following main components:

Login Page:
Customers must enter their credentials (username and password) to access the app's features securely.

Loan Types:
Four types of loans are offered: home loan, car loan, education loan, and personal loan. Each loan type has specific eligibility criteria and interest rates.

Savings Calculation:
Customers can calculate their savings by providing financial details such as income, expenses, and existing loans. The app performs calculations and provides an estimate of the customer's savings.

Loan Application:
Customers can apply for loans through the app. The application process is guided, ensuring all required information is provided. Applications are securely stored in the database for further processing.

Use Case Model:
The use case model includes the following actors:

Bank Staff:
Authorized personnel can access loan applications submitted by customers for review and approval.

Customer:
The primary user can log in, calculate savings, and apply for loans.

Software Requirements Specification
Python:
Tkinter is a Python library, so Python must be installed on the computer.
Python is a free and open-source programming language available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
